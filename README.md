## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was a good exercise for becoming more comfortable with Grid.  Also it was my first time doing mobile first and also strictly doing layout before adding any additional styling - which helped greatly. Also, my Git & GitHub process is much better with this exercise.

### Continued development

I would like to keep using Grid and Flexbox in challenges until it becomes second nature - practice!  

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Grid Layout Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This is a good reference for Grid.
